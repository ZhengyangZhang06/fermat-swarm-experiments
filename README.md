# Recursive Lean prover

This branch adds **`github-theorem-prover`**, a separate workflow built on
[`feature/github-node-workspace`](https://github.com/humanfia/math-lean-flow/tree/feature/github-node-workspace)
at `1275e4304940215bad57ad001cf4fd5f7059f5d3`. It creates an issue containing the exact
Lean problem and reviewed natural-language proof for every theorem and recursive
subtheorem, then publishes one verified solution PR per node. The root PR delivers
the complete integrated problem. Every problem also gets an automatically updated
status website with its theorem dependencies, verification progress, and issue/PR
links, published to GitHub Pages. The original default workflow remains available.

See [the GitHub theorem workflow guide](docs/github-theorem-workflow.md) and
[its example configuration](config.github-theorems.example.yaml).

The [persistent workflow requirements](docs/workflow-requirements.md) carry the
session's issue/PR lifecycle, autonomous scheduling, merge/close and live per-problem
DAG requirements into future runs. The [authorized configuration](config.github-theorems.authorized.example.yaml)
retains merge-and-close behavior for an explicitly authorized repository. The
[parallelism implementation plan](docs/parallel-theorem-workflow-plan.md) distinguishes
tested source changes from deployed multi-host behavior; do not infer fleet
readiness from the requirements document alone.

The GitHub theorem workflow now defaults to **eight autonomous issue-polling
workers**, with no per-job notifications from a parent or another worker. See
[polling, ownership and restart safety](docs/issue-polling-workers.md). The
push-dispatch scheduler described later remains available in `dispatch` mode;
the proof and independent verification gates are shared by both modes.

> **Parent-supplied-child-proof + GitHub-workspace variant.** This branch is intended for fresh runs. It is
> deliberately not compatible with child nodes created by the original workflow: an existing
> child without a reviewed `parent-child-handoff.json` fails closed instead of generating its own
> plan or natural-language proof. Do not point an already-running experiment at this checkout.

A native Humanize flow for recursively solving large mathematical problems in Lean. It uses the official
`humanize1:gen-plan` and `humanize1:rlcr` phases, recursively activates subproblem workers,
requires the repository comparator before and during every Lean review, displays a live DAG,
and publishes every accepted theorem to a Markdown wiki.

Before any planning or proof work, the flow downloads pinned snapshots of
[TauCeti](https://github.com/TauCetiProject/TauCeti),
[lean-pool](https://github.com/Vilin97/lean-pool), and the private
[mathlib-internal dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/humanfia-lab/mathlib-internal). It then
starts a dedicated fresh agent session that fetches exactly one pre-resolved problem from the
[Lean-Eval problem catalog](https://lean-lang.org/eval/problems/) and freezes a `problem.md` page
in the run artifacts. Planning, natural proof/review, decomposition, Lean RLCR, Lean review, and
integration repair all receive that one-problem artifact and the same three local reference
snapshots. Structured stages must return a three-source `reference_use` ledger, including an
explicit no-match report when a corpus has no relevant result.

This repository runs natively on the Humanize 2 `hmz` runtime and flow API. The component names
`official/humanize1:gen-plan` and `official/humanize1:rlcr` are the names under which Humanize 2's
official flowverse currently exposes the ported Humanize 1 algorithms; they do not mean that this
flow runs on the old Humanize 1 runtime. There are currently no `official/humanize2:gen-plan` or
`official/humanize2:rlcr` aliases.

Exactly one root scaffold plan is generated in `humanize1:gen-plan` direct mode, with no subsequent
plan-review or plan-revision stage, and retained unchanged. Recursive children do not call
`gen-plan` and do not run a natural-language author/reviewer loop. Instead, the parent decomposition
must supply a complete proof and ordered key steps for every child, and the independent
decomposition reviewer must approve each supplied proof before any child is activated. Mathematical defects are
handled by an RLCR-style natural-language loop that repeatedly revises the latest proof draft
from the fresh reviewer's exact first-invalid-step feedback. Exhausting a configured review
batch starts another batch from that checkpoint; it does not regenerate the plan or fail the
root node. A rejected proposed child proof returns to the parent's decomposition gate; Lean repair
keeps the accepted inherited proof frozen and never opens a child planning or prose-generation
stage.

When `github_workspace_remote` is configured, every accepted split is also exchanged through the
problem repository's GitHub remote. The parent commits one immutable dispatch branch containing
the reviewed decomposition and audit, all child theorem/proof bundles, fetched problem artifacts,
reference snapshot manifest, task, and controller contract. Every child fetches that exact commit,
checks all bundled SHA-256 digests, reconstructs any missing local handoff files, and creates its
own result branch from the dispatch commit. Only after the child comparator and independent
reviewer comparator both pass does the controller push that result branch. Siblings never push to
one shared writable branch.

The upstream direct gen-plan flow still asks its analyst to check that the input belongs to the
repository and to provide one pre-candidate risk analysis. Those calls happen before the planner
writes its one candidate; they are not candidate-plan convergence reviews. Direct mode skips the
reasonability-review/revision loop entirely. If an interrupted direct run leaves its substantive
output in an atomic-write temporary file, that output is frozen on resume. If no substantive
output survived, the concrete controller input draft is frozen instead and work advances to the
natural-language proof rather than generating another plan.

On resume, the scheduler scans the whole existing DAG and launches every dependency-ready
frontier node into one shared pool. It refills the pool whenever any node completes, so a newly
unblocked branch does not wait for an unrelated slow worker. Fresh decompositions likewise
launch every zero-indegree sibling in the first topological wave. Planning, natural-proof,
review, decomposition, Lean RLCR, comparator runs, and Lean review all run concurrently up to
`max_parallel_children`. Every formalizing node receives its own named Git branch and worktree,
and its official RLCR invocation runs in a separate process whose real working directory is that
worktree. Source edits, Humanize state, and comparator scratch files therefore cannot collide.
Only integration of fully reviewed histories is serialized. If parallel histories edited the
same Lean file, the controller preserves both changes in an integration worktree and requires
another comparator pass before advancing the problem branch. If that combined check fails, an
integration-only Codex repair loop preserves the accepted candidate, reconciles the histories,
and must pass both a machine comparator and a fresh reviewer comparator. It never returns the node
to planning, natural-language proof, decomposition, or theorem proving. Deep repository paths are
mapped to a stable short checkout path under `/tmp/humanize-lean-worktrees`; the named Git branch
retains the durable proof history even if that disposable checkout is later removed.
Each isolated checkout also receives its own ignored copy of the repository's pinned
`lake-manifest.json` and a link to the immutable `.lake/packages` checkout. This keeps Lean builds
offline-reproducible and prevents Lake from trying to update shared read-only Git metadata.

## How the flow works

1. **Prepare the reference library.** Before creating a theorem node, the controller clones
   TauCeti, lean-pool, and mathlib-internal into the ignored reference cache. It records the exact
   commit and absolute path of every snapshot in the first `manifest.json`, makes the snapshots
   read-only, and fails closed if any source is unavailable, incomplete, dirty, or no longer at its
   pinned commit. An interprocess lock serializes cache creation across experiment supervisors.
2. **Fetch exactly one problem.** The controller resolves one problem id from `problem_id`, an
   explicit problem URL, the workspace README, or the workspace directory. A named fresh agent
   session may fetch only that problem's canonical page and JSON. A schema rejects the catalog
   URL, a mismatched id/URL, or Markdown containing more than one top-level problem. The validated
   generated page is validated, then canonically rendered and atomically frozen as `problem.md`;
   resume reuses it instead of fetching another entry. The controller retains the complete
   authoritative v2 JSON, checks the agent's id, title, statement revision, module, and generation
   timestamp against it, and deterministically derives every official Markdown section from that
   JSON. Task-digest run selection and the sole acquisition-session checkpoint are locked and
   durable before network work, so an interruption or concurrent supervisor cannot silently create
   another fetch session.
3. **Restore or create the theorem node.** The controller loads the durable `dag.json`, preserves
   every accepted checkpoint, and creates the root only when no run exists.
4. **Generate one root scaffold.** The root invokes `humanize1:gen-plan` in direct mode exactly
   once. The resulting scaffold is frozen. Children receive a deterministic implementation
   contract from their parent and never invoke `gen-plan` themselves.
5. **Prove the root mathematics in natural language.** A Codex worker writes a complete proof and an
   independent Codex reviewer checks the first invalid step. A rejection revises the latest proof,
   not the scaffold. A deep, precisely stated non-circular lemma may be identified as a sourced
   decomposition obligation rather than expanded into a monograph before recursion starts; the
   following parent decomposition must nevertheless supply that child's complete proof. Vague
   citations and parent-equivalent obligations are rejected. `natural_proof_attempts` is only the size of one
   checkpoint batch: reaching it starts another batch from the latest draft and cannot kill the
   root node.
6. **Decide whether to split.** After the prose proof passes, a decomposition audit checks each
   proposed child theorem, its exact Lean statement and name, its complete parent-supplied natural
   proof and key steps, and the acyclic dependency list. The controller freezes these into
   `parent-child-handoff.json`, `parent-supplied-natural-proof.{json,md}`, and
   `parent-supplied-plan.md`. A child begins at recursive decomposition of that inherited proof;
   it cannot generate or revise its own plan or prose. When it splits, its decomposition supplies
   complete proofs to the grandchildren in the same way. Child
   declaration names are reserved across the whole live DAG: an active cross-branch collision is
   rejected before formal work, while a comparator-accepted declaration may be shared only when
   its frozen Lean type is identical.
   With a configured GitHub workspace remote, the controller then publishes the whole reviewed
   split to one immutable parent dispatch branch before starting any child. The dispatch commit is
   the frozen Git base of every child result branch, so handoff files remain remotely auditable but
   are excluded from the candidate commit range later integrated into the canonical problem branch.
7. **Launch the ready frontier.** Every node whose explicit prerequisites and required children
   have passed both isolated comparator gates is launched, up to `max_parallel_children`.
   Independent leaves from the same problem run together. A parent may therefore start while an
   accepted child is still `integrating`; the accepted child commits are overlaid into the
   parent's isolated worktree. In the diagram, `A --> B` always means that A depends on B.
8. **Formalize in isolation.** Each ready Lean node gets a named Git branch and a short independent
   worktree. The official `humanize1:rlcr` worker/reviewer loop builds the Lean proof without sharing
   source files or build scratch state with sibling workers. Its implementation reviewer checks the
   worker against the selected node contract and author comparator, then returns control; it does not
   start a second repository-wide code-review phase.
9. **Apply the acceptance gates.** The controller runs the project comparator, then a fresh Codex
   reviewer inspects the exact candidate and reruns that comparator itself. That creates an
   immutable accepted checkpoint and immediately unlocks dependants while canonical integration
   continues in the background. If concurrent proofs touched the same file, a separate integration
   worktree preserves both histories and the comparator checks the combined result.
   A non-root node configured for GitHub workspace exchange must also push the exact reviewed commit
   to its unique result branch before it becomes an accepted checkpoint. Parents fetch that remote
   result commit again before overlay or integration; a moved or divergent branch fails closed.
10. **Publish or revise.** Every accepted theorem is written to the wiki immediately and unlocks its
   dependants. A proposed child proof rejected by decomposition review is repaired by the parent
   before activation. Once activated, the child's inherited proof is immutable; isolated Lean,
   comparator, or Lean-review rejection remains in Lean repair and never creates a child plan or
   prose-authoring pass. A failure caused only by combining already accepted histories stays in `integrating` and
   enters a dedicated Codex repair plus machine/reviewer-comparator loop. It never invalidates or
   restarts the accepted NL proof and never sends false theorem-failure feedback to the parent.

## Requirements

- Humanize with the `hmz` command and an official `humanize1` flowverse exposing the RLCR
  `skip_code_review` setting. The flow refuses older installs rather than silently running the
  duplicate repository-wide review.
- Lean projects should pin `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.0` in `lean-toolchain` when reproducing the
  current Lean-Eval experiment.
- Network access for the one-problem agent and the initial reference downloads.
- A Hugging Face read token with access to the private `humanfia-lab/mathlib-internal` dataset,
  supplied through `HF_TOKEN` (or the configured `huggingface_token_env`). The token is used only
  through a Git askpass environment and is not written to YAML, prompts, manifests, logs, or Git
  remote URLs.
- Run at the root of a clean Lean git repository.
- For remote-backed node exchange, add a writable GitHub remote to that problem repository and use
  non-interactive SSH or credential-helper authentication. Do not embed tokens in the remote URL.
- Provide a comparator wrapper such as `tools/check-with-comparator.sh`.
- The comparator must exit zero and print the configured success marker.
- Use Codex for both declared roles. The two roles are separate agents and therefore keep
  worker and reviewer context independent.

The comparator is called once by the flow before review, then the reviewer is required to run
it again. It receives `HUMANIZE_NODE_ID`, `HUMANIZE_NODE_STATEMENT`,
`HUMANIZE_LEAN_FILES`, `HUMANIZE_RUN_DIR`, and `HUMANIZE_WIKI_DIR`. A repository that needs a
different comparator target for each generated lemma should use these values in its wrapper.

## Install

Install the flow directly into the user-flow directory:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:humanfia/math-lean-flow.git \
  ~/.humanize/flows/recursive_lean_prover
hmz check user/recursive_lean_prover
```

For an existing clone, update the installed flow with:

```sh
git -C ~/.humanize/flows/recursive_lean_prover pull --ff-only
hmz check user/recursive_lean_prover
```

## Run

First create a task file such as `PROBLEM.md`. It supplies experiment instructions and the local
Lean contract; it is no longer expected to be a hand-copied leaderboard page. Set `problem_id` in
the flow config for the strongest selection guarantee. When it is blank, the flow deterministically
derives one id from an explicit `https://lean-lang.org/eval/problems/<id>/` URL in the task, the
workspace README's `Problem ID`, or the workspace directory name. The fetch agent never chooses an
arbitrary item from the catalog.

Export the Hugging Face token in the shell that launches `hmz`. Do not put its value in the task or
config file:

```sh
export HF_TOKEN='<your read token>'
```

Provide a project-specific comparator wrapper. It must return a nonzero status on rejection and
print the configured marker only after every required check succeeds. Adapt this outline to the
repository's real evaluator:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
lake env lean Submission.lean
./tools/project-comparator "$HUMANIZE_NODE_ID"
printf '%s\n' 'Your solution is okay!'
```

The wrapper can use `HUMANIZE_NODE_ID`, `HUMANIZE_NODE_STATEMENT`,
`HUMANIZE_LEAN_FILES`, `HUMANIZE_RUN_DIR`, and `HUMANIZE_WIKI_DIR`. Never print the success marker
before the real evaluator succeeds.

Copy and edit the example config, especially `lean_target` and `comparator_command`:

```sh
cp ~/.humanize/flows/recursive_lean_prover/config.example.yaml ./recursive-proof.yaml
```

To enable GitHub workspace exchange, first add or verify a writable remote in the **problem
repository**, then name it in the config:

```sh
git remote add proof-workspace git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/YOUR_PROBLEM_REPOSITORY.git
# recursive-proof.yaml:
# github_workspace_remote: proof-workspace
```

For a parent node `P`, the flow pushes one branch below
`<prefix>/<project>/<run>/dispatch/<P>`. Each child has a separate
`humanize-recursive/<project>/<run>/<child>-aN` result branch. Dispatch branches are immutable;
the flow refuses a changed remote head, digest mismatch, foreign file, divergent result writer, or
local handoff that differs from the fetched bundle.

The settings most often changed are:

- `max_depth`: deepest recursive decomposition level; the root is depth 0.
- `max_children` and `max_nodes`: fan-out and total DAG bounds.
- `max_parallel_children`: number of dependency-ready nodes allowed to work concurrently.
- `natural_proof_attempts`: revisions per saved batch, not a total proof-attempt limit.
- `rlcr_rounds`: rounds in one official Lean RLCR invocation.
- `comparator_timeout: 21600`: six hours for each comparator execution.
- `problem_id`: the sole Lean-Eval problem permitted for the acquisition session; blank enables
  deterministic workspace inference.
- `problem_fetch_attempts`: schema-correction attempts within that one fresh fetch session.
- `reference_dir`: ignored cache containing all three pinned reference checkouts.
- `huggingface_token_env`: name of the environment variable carrying the private dataset token.
- `lean_target`: project-relative candidate `.lean` file.
- `comparator_command`: argv-style command; it is not evaluated by a shell.
- `github_workspace_remote`: existing problem-repository Git remote used for dispatch/result
  exchange; blank disables remote exchange.
- `github_workspace_branch_prefix`: namespace for immutable parent dispatch branches.
- `github_workspace_push_timeout`: bound for each remote query, fetch, and push.

Then run both worker and reviewer on Codex:

```sh
hmz exec -f user/recursive_lean_prover -c recursive-proof.yaml \
  -a cli=codex,model=gpt-5.6-sol,effort=max,permission=auto,web_search=on \
  -a cli=codex,model=gpt-5.6-sol,effort=max,permission=auto,web_search=on \
  "$(cat PROBLEM.md)"
```

Both roles use `permission=auto`: RLCR's plan-integrity guards operate on permission requests,
and a Lean comparator may need to write build artifacts. The reviewer prompt forbids edits and
the reviewer remains a separate Codex agent with independent sessions.

Use `Ctrl-C` to stop only this foreground supervisor. To resume, run the same `hmz exec` command
with the same task text, config, and repository. The flow reuses the durable run, accepted proof
nodes, Git branches, wiki pages, and the latest rejected natural-language draft. Do not use a broad
`pkill` when other experiments share the machine.

## Observe

At startup the flow prints its run directory. In a second terminal:

```sh
run_dir="$(cat .humanize/recursive-lean-prover/LATEST)"
watch -n 1 "sed -n '1,220p' \"$run_dir/DAG.md\""
```

The same directory contains `dag.json` and `dag.mmd`. Each problem workspace owns a wiki indexed
at `.humanize/math-wiki/README.md`. A theorem is published as soon as that node passes its
controller comparator and the fresh reviewer's independent rerun; publication does not wait for
the root theorem or the rest of the problem. Pages include the natural proof, frozen scaffold,
Lean source, recursion level, and comparator evidence.

The run directory also contains exactly one fetched `problem.md`, its structured `problem.json`,
and `preflight.json`. The reference cache's `manifest.json` records all three repository commits.
`DAG.md` repeats the problem and reference-manifest paths for every live status view. Downloads are
reused on resume; they are not silently refreshed midway through an experiment.

The Mermaid diagram uses one line style and one direction convention everywhere: every solid arrow
`A --> B` means **A depends on B**, so B must be proved before A can finish. A parent theorem points
to each theorem created by its decomposition, and a theorem points to every explicit prerequisite
listed in `depends_on`. A node can therefore be a decomposition leaf while still pointing to an
upstream prerequisite. The node label and status table say `dependency-ready` or list the exact
blocking prerequisite.

## Review gates

- Root direct planning performs an input relevance check and one pre-candidate analysis. It skips
  candidate convergence review and plan revision. Children never invoke this stage.
- A root natural-language reviewer runs once the author reports no unresolved gaps. Rejection
  revises the latest root proof draft indefinitely; it never regenerates the plan.
- A decomposition reviewer checks every proposed child statement, exact frozen Lean type,
  dependency edge, complete supplied proof, and proof key steps after the current node's prose
  proof passes. A child is not activated unless both its contract and supplied proof pass.
- The official RLCR implementation loop reviews every Lean worker round against the current audited
  DAG node, frozen type, accepted dependency list, and author comparator. Once that implementation
  reviewer accepts the candidate, RLCR returns control immediately. The bridge explicitly sets
  Humanize's setup-only `skip_code_review` switch; merely leaving the base blank is insufficient
  because Humanize normally auto-detects `main`. Enabling that second repository-wide review would
  duplicate the controller review, would not enforce the exact comparator, and could reopen accepted
  child histories. The exact post-overlay base remains recorded in the node configuration for audit.
- The controller runs the comparator with a default six-hour timeout. Only after that passes does
  a fresh Lean reviewer inspect the exact candidate and personally rerun the same comparator.
- If independently accepted histories must be combined, integration runs the comparator again on
  the merged candidate before advancing the problem branch. A failed combined check retains the
  accepted proof and runs integration-only repair followed by another machine comparator and a
  fresh reviewer comparator; it does not restart the theorem or NL proof.
- With `speculative_parent_formalization`, a decomposed parent starts Lean coding immediately
  against controller-generated temporary declarations carrying its children's exact frozen types.
  The temporary declarations exist only in an isolated speculative worktree and are removed before
  the controller records the draft commit. The parent then appears as `speculative-lean` or
  `speculative-ready`, never idle as `waiting-children`. Comparator and reviewer gates remain
  disabled for that draft until real child candidates replace every assumption. A parent may also
  consume comparator-approved child candidates while they integrate; its final isolated worktree
  overlays those exact commits and rechecks the combination. The root cannot become `proved` until
  all descendant integration gates and its own final comparator contract pass.
- Every node records a frozen proof-base commit. Kernel-checked definitions and helper lemmas at
  that base may be reused as library infrastructure; the child list governs only post-base
  candidate overlays and is not an exhaustive theorem allowlist.
- A root mathematical rejection returns to the latest root natural-language proof. A proposed
  child-proof rejection stays at the parent's decomposition gate. After activation, the child
  proof bundle is frozen and only Lean repair iterates. The full outer comparator/reviewer pass
  freezes the candidate, marks it `integrating`, publishes it, and unlocks dependants. Only the
  subsequent canonical integration gate marks the node `proved`.

## DAG scheduling

On resume, the scheduler scans the complete persisted DAG. Every node whose dependencies have
passed both isolated comparator gates enters the global frontier together, up to
`max_parallel_children`. In speculative mode, every decomposed parent also starts immediately
against exact-type temporary child assumptions while those child workers continue. Accepted
`integrating` nodes unlock dependants immediately; their exact candidate commits are overlaid into
the dependant's isolated worktree. Root planning/prose, recursive decomposition with parent-proof
handoffs, speculative parent coding, Lean implementation, comparator passes, and serialized
integration can therefore overlap. Same-file reconciliations are performed in a separate
integration worktree and comparator-checked before the canonical branch advances. Any
reconciliation failure remains in an integration-only repair loop; the accepted node branch,
scaffold, NL proof, comparator result, reviewer result, theorem identity, and wiki page remain
immutable checkpoints. Re-decomposition reuses an existing accepted Lean theorem by name at any
depth instead of creating an `-a2` copy or proving it again. The root still waits for every
descendant integration future before final acceptance.

With remote exchange enabled, `dag.json` also records each node's dispatch remote, immutable
handoff branch/commit, child result branch/commit, manifest path, and bundle path. Those fields are
the resume authority: missing coordinates, a rewritten dispatch head, a result head that does not
equal the reviewed candidate, or a branch outside the recorded ancestry stops that child instead
of falling back to local-only work.

## Safety and stopping

The official RLCR loop commits Lean changes as it works and runs coding agents with Humanize's
permission prompting disabled. Plans, DAG state, comparator logs, and the wiki stay below
`.humanize/` so they do not enter RLCR's git-clean gate. A stopped run is resumable: running the
same task again in the same repository reuses its durable run directory, already approved wiki
pages, and nested RLCR state.

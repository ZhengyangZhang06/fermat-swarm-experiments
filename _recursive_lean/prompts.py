PLAN_DRAFT = """# Recursive Lean theorem node

## Frozen problem acquisition

{problem_context}

## Required research sources

{reference_context}

## Mathematical task

{statement}

## Node identity

- DAG node: `{node_id}`
- Proposed Lean name: `{lean_name}`
- Depth: {depth}
- Parent: `{parent}`

## Required order of work

1. Produce and independently review a complete natural-language proof before writing Lean.
2. From that proof, identify named subproblems with explicit dependency edges when a split is
   useful. Each child must be a self-contained theorem, not merely a tactic-level action.
3. Use the already comparator-approved child theorems when formalizing this node.
4. Formalize the exact statement in Lean in `{lean_target}`. Do not weaken the theorem,
   assumptions, imports, or declarations, and do not introduce axioms, `sorry`, or placeholders.
5. Run `{comparator_command}`. The theorem is not proved unless it exits zero and emits
   `{comparator_success}`.
6. Require a fresh reviewer to inspect the Lean changes and rerun the comparator.
7. Publish every accepted theorem from this node to the run's Markdown wiki.

This artifact is a plan, not the natural-language proof itself. It must give a concrete,
mathematically plausible route and checks for every step, but it must remain a concise scaffold;
the next gated RLCR phase writes, critiques, and revises the complete proof. Do not replace the
proof-producing route with a feasibility report, failure disposition, request for a new run, or
a list of controller decisions. Exact child Lean signatures, DAG node IDs, and detailed formal
interfaces are derived only after the complete prose proof passes review, so do not try to
pre-build that later decomposition here. Lean files already present when this flow began are
inherited proof-base material, not new formalization performed out of order. Their presence does
not by itself prove the current node. However, definitions and kernel-checked helper lemmas
already present at the node's frozen proof-base commit may be reused as ordinary library
infrastructure when the configured comparator and source-safety checks accept them. The
approved-child list governs candidate histories overlaid after that base; it is not an exhaustive
allowlist of declarations available from the base. A previous unapproved proof of the current
theorem, a placeholder, a new axiom, or a non-base candidate history still requires its
corresponding checkpoint gates. Do not invent controller receipts or services beyond the
configured DAG, wiki, Git checks, and comparator commands.
The root is validated directly against the official trusted Challenge declarations, so its
aggregate DAG name and absence of a child-only frozen type are not defects.

## Acceptance criteria

- Every numbered proof step states why it follows.
- The one-time scaffold gives a concrete proof-producing route and is never iterated.
- Natural language precedes Lean formalization.
- Every required child is comparator-approved before the parent is accepted.
- The machine comparator and the independent reviewer both pass.
- The theorem and its provenance are present in the wiki and the DAG says `proved`.

NATURAL_PROOF = """Write the complete natural-language proof for this theorem before any Lean
formalization. Number every logical step. State every lemma with all hypotheses, explain why it
is true, and show exactly how the lemmas imply the requested result.

This is the proof-architecture gate immediately before recursive decomposition. Prove ordinary
steps in full. A genuinely deep lemma whose proof would dominate this response may instead be
declared as a decomposition obligation, but only when you:
- state its complete mathematical hypotheses and conclusion;
- show exactly where it is used and why it is strictly narrower than the requested theorem;
- give a non-circular proof strategy with enough intermediate structure to decompose further; and
- cite an exact public source (theorem/section/page when available) for any imported mathematical
  result, or give the substantive argument when no such source is used.
A vague named lemma, a restatement or immediate equivalent of the parent, an appeal to the result
being proved, or any protected benchmark solution is still an unresolved gap. A validly specified
decomposition obligation is not itself an unresolved point: the next gate freezes it as a child,
and its own prose, Lean implementation, comparator, and independent review must still pass.

be accepted here as a decomposition obligation when it is strictly narrower than the parent, has
all hypotheses and its exact role stated, and is backed by a non-circular structured proof strategy
and/or an exact public mathematical citation. Do not require a book-length proof of such an

DECOMPOSE = """After reading the complete natural-language proof below, decide whether it
should be factored into separately named Lean theorems. This decision is made at every depth,
so a subproblem may itself activate more workers. Split only on genuine reusable mathematical
obligations. When splitting, return 2 to {max_children} self-contained statements, unique
snake_case keys, proposed bare Lean identifiers, sibling dependencies, and a complete
natural-language proof for every child. The proof belongs to the parent-to-child contract: the
child receives it verbatim and skips both plan generation and natural-language author/reviewer
generation. Therefore each child's `natural_proof` must number the argument, prove that child's
exact self-contained statement from its hypotheses, and contain no unresolved step, circular
appeal, placeholder, or instruction to discover a proof later. Also return `proof_key_steps`, the
ordered logical spine of that proof. Extract and specialize the relevant argument from the parent
proof, filling in details needed to make the child proof independently usable.

A child's
`lean_name` must be only `X`, never `Submission.X`, `Submission_X`, or `SubmissionX`; the
implementation and comparator will refer to that declaration as `Submission.X`. For each child, also give
`lean_statement`: the exact, single-line Lean proposition/type expression for that theorem,
without `theorem`, a declaration name, or `:=` proof. It must elaborate after `import Submission`
before child proof work begins. This type is frozen and later becomes the independent challenge
side of the child comparator. A proposed `lean_name` must not collide with a declaration already
reserved by another active DAG branch. An exact comparator-accepted declaration may be reused only
with the identical frozen Lean type; otherwise choose a globally unique bare identifier.
Dependencies must be acyclic.
When a typeclass-sensitive object is constructed inline, verify the inferred instance rather than
only checking that the proposition elaborates. In particular, write `IsUnit (Matrix.of (fun ...))`
for a constructed square matrix: `IsUnit (fun ... : Matrix ...)` silently selects pointwise
function multiplication instead of matrix multiplication.
Return no children when the theorem is already atomic or depth {depth} reached the limit
{max_depth}. Do not use `sorry`, placeholders, or circular restatements of the parent.

and every `lean_statement` is an exact one-line Lean proposition matching its prose statement.
Read each child's `natural_proof` independently, step by step. Set
`natural_proof_acceptable=true` only when it proves that child's exact statement, uses every
hypothesis correctly, contains no hidden gap or circular reliance on the child/parent theorem, and
is detailed enough to guide formalization without a new child planning or prose-generation pass.
The parent is solely responsible for supplying this proof; reject a decomposition that merely
describes how the child might later search for or construct one.
Check that every `lean_name` is a bare identifier `X` intended to be declared as `Submission.X`,
not an attempted encoding of the namespace such as `Submission_X` or `SubmissionX`.
Reject a name already reserved by another active DAG branch. Reuse of a previously
comparator-accepted declaration is valid only when the frozen Lean type is identical.
The frozen Lean type must be independently usable as the challenge side of a comparator; reject

  background only: do not reopen planning or decomposition, require additional DAG nodes or
  interfaces, or replace the controller's already audited selected dependency graph.
- Definitions and kernel-checked helper lemmas already present at the frozen proof-base commit may

  overlaid after that base; an empty list does not ban proof-base helpers. Do not reject a
  comparator-passing implementation solely because such a helper predates the flow or is not on a
  child wiki page. This permission does not cover an unapproved prior proof of this node, a
  placeholder, a new axiom, or a candidate history absent from both the base and approved children.
- Create or complete a globally named theorem for this node; do not hide it as a local `have`.
- For a child node, its declaration must have exactly the frozen expected Lean type above.
- Preserve the exact target, hypotheses, imports, and declarations.
- For a non-root node, every declaration already present at the frozen proof-base commit is frozen
  baseline content, including the root challenge placeholder. Preserve that inherited placeholder;
  do not remove, complete, rename, or replace it while implementing a child. The child comparator
  deliberately subtracts its frozen warning baseline, so an inherited root `sorry` is not a child
  failure. A warning-clean child means that this candidate introduces no new warning. Add the
  selected child theorem beside the baseline declarations.
- For a non-root node, do not use a whole-file `lake --wfail` or `-DwarningAsError=true` run as an
  acceptance gate: it cannot distinguish the expected inherited root warning. Ordinary compilation
  is useful during development, but the exact configured child comparator below is authoritative
  for baseline-aware warning cleanliness.
- Do not add any new `sorry`, `admit`, axiom, unsafe loophole, or weakened replacement theorem.
- Run `{comparator_command}` until it exits zero and contains `{comparator_success}`.
- For a non-root node, that exact node comparator is the complete configured correctness gate.
  Do not run the official root/whole-benchmark comparator or validate unrelated parent or sibling
  theorems; those checks consume the shared build pool and are outside this node's boundary.
- Commit only real Lean/project changes with a conventional descriptive commit.
- Do not edit anything under `.humanize/` except files the RLCR runtime itself requires.

This nested RLCR stage owns only implementation, a warning-clean build, a clean committed
candidate, and the author's comparator run. Return successfully as soon as those are complete.
Do not wait for, simulate, or mark complete the outer controller's fresh-reviewer comparator
rerun, wiki publication, or DAG `proved` transition: those gates run only after this nested
stage returns. Treating those later gates as unfinished RLCR work creates a circular wait.
The nested reviewer is a Git-diff and comparator-input integrity auditor, not a mathematical
proof or code-quality reviewer. It checks the frozen issue contract, unchanged context, exact
candidate files supplied to the comparator, clean committed state, and comparator evidence.
It must not independently re-prove the theorem, critique tactics, or reopen the accepted
